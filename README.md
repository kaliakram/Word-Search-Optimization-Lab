# Word-Search-Optimization-Lab

A laboratory project on optimizing word-search operations using various Binary Search Tree (BST) variants, implemented first in Z (by Pr. Zegour at ESI Algiers) and then automatically translated to C.

##  Overview

This is the second lab of the ALSDD (Algorithms & Dynamic Data Structures) module at ESI Algiers. Its goals are to:

- Deepen understanding of tree data structures, especially BSTs.
- Experiment with self-adjusting BST variants to speed up word searches.
- Compare three modified BSTs (BST1–3) against a standard BST (BST0).

## ⚙ Lab Components

### 1. Z Language Version

- **Compiler required**: [KHAWARIZM for Z](https://zegour.esi.dz/Ftp/Khawarism2_afe.7z)  
- **Behavioral variants**:
  - **BST1**: On inserting a word beginning with X, Y, or Z, rotate it to the root.
  - **BST2**: On inserting a word beginning with X, Y, or Z, rotate it to the midpoint of its search path.
  - **BST3**: On inserting a word *not* beginning with X, Y, or Z, rotate it to the root.
- **Core requirements**:
  - Implement standard BST operations (in-order traversal, breadth-first word count, etc.) to validate structure.
  - Implement single-word and range-word search methods.

### 2. C Language Version

- **Automatic translation**: Generated by the Z compiler’s translation feature.
- **Enhancements**:
  - Improved console display with colors for better visualization.
  - Implementation of **BST0** (a standard, unmodified BST) for baseline comparison.
  - Simulation harness to collect and output performance data (note: full simulation wasn’t completed in this lab).
